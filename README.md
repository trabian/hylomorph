# Hylomorph: Redux-Form Components

The goal behind Hylomorph is to provide simple components for common input types. Out of the box, Hylomorph is designed to work with redux-form, but components should work without it.

## Why

The React world has many great form component libraries, Hylomorph is not looking to recreate those, but to wrap them up, providing a standard way to display validation, labels, etc.

##What's with the name?

Hylomorph is taken from the word [Hylomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hylomorphism). It is an Aristotelian notion that describes the combination of *form* and matter. Hylomorph is pronounced with a long "i" - high-luh-morph.
